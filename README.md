# Github-Access
## Part 1: Github Access 
#### Files of interest: 
#### - Github-Access.py

This program, written in python, allows a user to log into their github account and input any existing Github username from the command line. The program generates a nested piechart showing what languages the inputted user has programmed in and how many repositories use each language. The inner ring represents the number of repositories.

## Part 2: Social Graph 
#### Files of interest: 
#### - SocialGraph.py
#### - index.html
#### - data.js

This project extends the functionality of my Github-Access assignment. The user can run the **SocialGraph.py** program form the command line. They are prompted to log into their Github account and to enter an existing usernamem like before. The program lists out every repository that is owned by the inputted username. The user enters the name of one of the repository's listed. The program then gathers data regarding the number of accumulative commits per user everyday and writes it to a javascript file, **data.js**. I then implemented the following d3 library in **index.html** : http://bl.ocks.org/chaitanyagurrapu/6007521. I did have to correct a few bugs that existed in the code, and then change it around to work for the specific type of data I wanted to display, as before it was just based on random numbers generated by a function. The number of commits per person per day between the date of the first commit and the date of the last commit is represented as a pie chart. The pie charts show the contribution of each person over the development of the repository everyday in a month. The user can click back and forward through months aswell. I chose to graph this particular data, as it is a better indicator of who is contributing the most consistently throughout a project as opposed to viewing just the total numbers of commits per person on Github.
